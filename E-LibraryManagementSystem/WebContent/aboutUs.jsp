<h2>About Library Management System</h2><hr>
<p>Online Library Management System is a system which maintains the 
    information about the books present in the library, their authors, the members of library to whom books are issued, 
    library staff and all. This is very difficult to organize manually. Maintenance of all this information manually is 
    a very complex task. Owing to the advancement of technology, organization of an Online Library becomes much simple. 
    The Online Library Management has been designed to computerize and automate the operations performed over the 
    information about the members, book issues and returns and all other operations. This computerization of
    library helps in many instances of its maintenances. It reduces the workload of
    management as most of the manual work done is reduced.</p><br>

<p>The user can also maintain and edit his profile details. A user can 
    sign-in and search for items, borrow items if they are present in the library. All details of the 
    users and library information are stored in the database. The user need not visit the library 
    every time to find an item; instead, he/she can search items from his/her own PC/laptop.</p>
